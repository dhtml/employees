## Introduction

A Simple Employee Form written in php. It accepts user inputs and returns sql queries as the end result.


## Features

* Specify the number of employees (index.php)
* Generate the employees form (start.php)
* Submit the form and return sql queries for insertion (save.php)

## Note
start.php submits to a blank window because of the target set to blank on line 14.
```
<form method="post" target="_blank" action="save.php">
```
To make it submit to the same page, alter that line to
```
<form method="post" target="_self" action="save.php">
```
or
```
<form method="post" action="save.php">
```
